# Once Upon A Time...
A while ago, I read an [interesting thread](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/are-you-an-entp-and-wonder-why-you-cant-get-things-done-when-working-for-yourself.96475/) about being an ENTP.
The crux was that ENTP-types are motivated by curiosity and tend to hop rapidly between intense burst of interest, and have trouble focussing on a single thing to completion (at least, in the absence of hard deadlines etc). 
Nothing new there. 
The key point, though, was that spending time Learning About Stuff That Takes Your Fancy is all well and good, but ultimately a bit pointless: instead, the author suggests, create something (anything) out of it. 

Like, say, a blog post.

Although Meyers-Briggs types are generally accepted to be just star signs for middle-managers, the thread struck a chord with me and I decided to start a blog, to try and produce _something_ concrete out of some of the ideas or experiences I have and maybe someone out there will find it interesting.
I then (as the commit history reveals) promptly got distracted and forgot about it. 
But now, the urge is back, and so is the blog. 
It remains to be seen if or when I actually use it, but at least it now exists as a possibility.
